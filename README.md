**Notes about the video**
========================

**The importance of learning patterns:**
------------------------------------

- Always pay attention to patterns as you're learning every concept.
- Spend more time practicing than memorizing. Especially when getting exposed consistently to different concepts will become 2nd nature.

**Re-try old problems:**
---------------------

- Writing down what you think you have to do. (Pseudo coding)

Practice atleast 5 times:
-------------------------

- Re-do the problems you've done 5-7 times in edabit and pick a certain tag or topic and pick a level. (https://edabit.com/)

**Allocate your time:**
---------------------

- While in a bootcamp practice after the end of the day, week, month. 1 hour waking up and 1 hour before sleeping.

**5 Areas where you should be efficient with your time while learning to code fast**
====================================================================================

Either it's duh or why?
1. Asking for help cuz your ceilling has to be high meaning the problem that you can deal with and learn how to be resourceful and asking the right question. (Find people or in an environment where you can ask people. Stop helding yourself back for too long)
2. Keeping in mind the content whether it's text based or video base. (Beware of extra materials)
3. Build something the highest quality you can it better have a damn good portfolio. (Avoid sloppy projects it should be good enough in your portfolio.)
4. Allocate your time to teach your peers, wife, or dog. (Give time to teach someone else)

- After mentoring a lot of aspiring software developers they realized that allocating time for yourself, family, partner, pets, and friends that helps you get there not the friends that are just randomly wasting your time. (Happy wife Happy life)

- Prioritization is really crucial for allocating your time. Focus on categories and ranking these concepts you're trying to learn. (Disciplined with a routine)

**4 Buckets of Prioritization**
--------------------------------

1. Family time
2. Boot camp journey or self-studying coding
3. Health (Exercise, Sleep 7 hours, food you're eating, and proper and consistent hygiene)
4. Personal time and friends whether related or unrelated to your career

Your learning circle should be:
-----------------------------------

1. Research (Knowing where to search the structure of your study material)
2. Content (Knowing if you learn more while doing or reading)
3. Building (Build your own projects in every concept to build upon and remember)
4. Teaching (Feymann technique write notes in github to teach yourself when forgetting certain code structures)
