**Notes about the video**
========================

**The importance of learning patterns:**
------------------------------------

- Always pay attention to patterns as you're learning every concept.
- Spend more time practicing than memorizing. Especially when getting exposed consistently to different concepts will become 2nd nature.

**Re-try old problems:**
---------------------

- Writing down what you think you have to do. (Pseudo coding)

Practice atleast 5 times:
-------------------------

- Re-do the problems you've done 5-7 times in edabit and pick a certain tag or topic and pick a level. (https://edabit.com/)

**Allocate your time:**
---------------------

- While in a bootcamp practice after the end of the day, week, month. 1 hour waking up and 1 hour before sleeping.

**5 Areas where you should be efficient with your time while learning to code fast**
====================================================================================

Either it's duh or why?
1. Asking for help cuz your ceilling has to be high meaning the problem that you can deal with and learn how to be resourceful and asking the right question. (Find people or in an environment where you can ask people. Stop helding yourself back for too long)
2. Keeping in mind the content whether it's text based or video base. (Beware of extra materials)
3. Build something the highest quality you can it better have a damn good portfolio. (Avoid sloppy projects it should be good enough in your portfolio.)
4. Allocate your time to teach your peers, wife, or dog. (Give time to teach someone else)

- After mentoring a lot of aspiring software developers they realized that allocating time for yourself, family, partner, pets, and friends that helps you get there not the friends that are just randomly wasting your time. (Happy wife Happy life)

- Prioritization is really crucial for allocating your time. Focus on categories and ranking these concepts you're trying to learn. (Disciplined with a routine)

**4 Buckets of Prioritization**
--------------------------------

1. Family time
2. Boot camp journey or self-studying coding
3. Health (Exercise, Sleep 7 hours, food you're eating, and proper and consistent hygiene)
4. Personal time and friends whether related or unrelated to your career

**Difference between happiness and fullfilment**
-------------------------------------------------

- Happiness is temporary and fullfilment is eternal.


**The concept of goal setting from aspiring software developers**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Maintaining marriage and time with kids
2. Getting a career within the field
3. Achieving personal goal like winning a soccer league

**How to help yourself to prioritize by using Eisenhower's matrix**
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Provide value happiness will follow up, but what's important to other person may not be important to others.

1. "Do it now": (Book: 7 habits of important people)
2. "Plan it now": Important, but still plan when to do it
3. "Delegate it now": Have your partner or friends help you with something that's urgent, but low value
4. "Remove it now": Place it at the bottom line

Your learning circle should be:
-----------------------------------

1. Research

- Do your research AHEAD of time.
- Avoid getting surprised by the content.
- Prevents rabbitholes where you're wandering to random content.

2. Content

- Now you're exposed through research. I don't learn by reading also and video, but by practicing multiple times.
- Some boot camps are video based and no mentors which is not quite effective.

3. Building
   
- Make sure its portfolio quality.
- Make sure do a project that you understand and can explain it.

5. Teaching
   
- Most people skip the teaching part, which is really important for executing what you learned.
- Make a youtube video about what you learned and watch how you explained it.

**Networking is really crucial at getting a career even when you're not in the industry yet**
=============================================================================================

1. Most people don't network very well
2. Not good enough portfolio AKA projects done
3. Lacking interview skills

**Why the university has failed a lot of computer science students in the long-run and achieving their career early on**
=============================================================================================

1. They thought that learning a piece about everything is great.
2. Instead of focusing more on programming skills and mastering. 
3. Switching languages too much and not focusing on project based learning.
4. Junior and senior is all about theory and no implementation.
5. Not being able to build and teach anything through coding.

**Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard
By Erik Trautman**
=======================================

https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/

**Phase I: The Hand-Holding Honeymoon**
---------------------------------------

- Learn to code movement has softened the stereotype that coding is incredibly difficult. It is really tough to learn from the beginning, especially if fear is not actually the problem but it's the overabundance of hopes and high expectations.

![image](https://github.com/JaritoThe3rd/Learn-to-Code-4-Ways-to-Learn-to-Code-Fast-Thinkful/assets/105878774/fb9f577f-b0b2-4226-9832-d7603d041439)

**Charting The Path Ahead**
----------------------------

- Confidence is highly correlated with your happiness and because the point where your confidence and capabilities match is the best proxy. When considering you're "job ready".

1. The Hand Holding Honeymoon

- joy-filled through highly polished resources teaching you things that seem tricky but are totally do-able with their support. (Learning basic syntax but feel great about your early accomplishments)

2. The Cliff of Confusion

- Painful realization that you can't do anything in your own yet without asking any questions and making too many mistakes.
  
- Your main problems are constant debugging and not quite knowing how to ask the right questions as your momentum gets consistently halted.

3. The Desert of Despair

- Long and lonely journey through a pathless landscape where every new direction seems correct.
  
- You're starving for more accurate resources and simple instructions to execute your project or understand the concept.

4. Upswing of Awesome

- Pulling yourself together and understanding and executing how to build applications.
  
- But your code is still house of cards.
  
- Your website or project seems to run. you've mastered a few useful patterns, and your friends think your interfaces are cool.

- You're at the production ready code, but still wondering how to get the actual job.

**Phase II: The Cliff of Confusion**
-----------------------------------

- You've arrived at the "Peak of Irrational Exuberance"
  
- It occurs during many aspiring learners just went through suffering and lost their dreams.
  
- It begins when you started to make your own project from scratch without looking at your notes or asking someone for help.

**Starship Troopers Bug Attack**
--------------------------------

- The most frustrating phase to witness from an educator and participants of the industry.

- Programming may not be perfect for anyone, but small things can be a huge success for someone.
  
- Still very early and you've dealth with some bugs.

**The Two Key Factors at Play**
===============================

**Factor 1: Resource Density**
-----------------------------

- You will feel overwhelmed with resources trying to narrow down which ones are worth doing.
  
- There's a fine line between amount of resources available and when you first start building your own project without looking up at anything.

![image](https://github.com/JaritoThe3rd/Learn-to-Code-4-Ways-to-Learn-to-Code-Fast-Thinkful/assets/105878774/68c84054-1f8b-41ed-8520-2cb8bfef1877)

**Factor 2: Scope of Knowledge**
-----------------------------

![image](https://github.com/JaritoThe3rd/Learn-to-Code-4-Ways-to-Learn-to-Code-Fast-Thinkful/assets/105878774/b0dc773d-42d9-428c-bb6d-03fa5c8237a8)

- Narrow part of your knowledge is knowing and understanding how to build what a forloop is, how to build conditional logic, and other basic structures of programming syntax.
  
- Things get fuzzy when you started to move away from the basics and understanding errors and when to use a code.
  
- When you progress into the third phase, the scope of knowledge balloons wider. You now need to understand what tools to use, what languages to learn, underlying CS fundamentals, how to write modular code, object-orientation, good style, and how to ask for help (to name just a few). Every trip to Google or Hacker News takes you down another set of rabbit holes and overwhelms you with more things you don't know but feel like you should.

You don't know what you don't know.

**Phase III: The Desert of Despair**
------------------------------------

- The pain caused by the toxic combination of a rapidly increasing Scope of Knowledge and a falling Resource Density results in what I call the "Desert of Despair".

![image](https://github.com/JaritoThe3rd/Learn-to-Code-4-Ways-to-Learn-to-Code-Fast-Thinkful/assets/105878774/3de8d684-94cf-4970-b9c2-57234b99f89f)

- dozens of tempting resources which appear to hold the solutions you're looking for but which will deposit you, once again, in a place where lonely sand extends to each horizon line.
  
- You can't learn this stuff in a week or a month or a single college class no matter what anyone says so stop falling for that!
  
- Even if you're pointing the right direction, it's hard to measure your progress. You might feel totally lost until the very moment when you're finally able to build something that looks and acts the way you expected it to.
  
- But, with enough perseverance and a good compass, you'll eventually get your first few "real" projects launched and you'll realize that you're finally starting to get it.

**Phase IV: The Upswing of Awesome**
-------------------------------------

- You can make that application work but what's happening beneath the surface? Your code is duct tape and string and, worst of all, you don’t even know which parts are terrible and which are actually just fine.
  
- This is a bipolar phase. You feel like half of you is a bulletproof developer and the other half is a thin veneer of effectiveness covering a wild-eyed newbie who is in way too deep. The further you progress, the more a gnawing sense of uncertainty grows that someone is going to "out" you as a fraud.

**How to Make it Through Alive**
=================================

**I: Surviving the Hand-Holding Honeymoon**
-------------------------------------------

1. Start by trying out different resources to find how you learn best and what sorts of projects are the most interesting to you. Maybe it's Khan Academy's quick challenges, Codecademy's in-browser exercises, or Thinkful's one-on-one mentorship experience. Be open minded at the start and ignore anything about what you should learn... all code is the same at this phase.
   
2. Then pick one resource and stick with it once you've found your fit. Work through to the end of their introductory course arc, which should give you all the foundational knowledge you need to write basic scripts and apps. Then get ready to start building on your own.

**II: Surviving the Cliff of Confusion**
----------------------------------------

1. Work with someone else, even another beginner. You'll be surprised how much easier it is to debug an impossible error when sharing two pairs of eyes.

2. Read other people's code to get comfortable with good patterns. Try to understand why the author did what they did. You wouldn't try to become a novelist without reading books as well, would you? We'll focus on this in an upcoming post but, for now, keep your eyes open for any small problems or projects that other people have written solutions for.

3. Start small and build constantly. You should have interesting big projects in mind for the future, but you'll need to get comfortable debugging and searching for resources with bite-sized challenges. There's really no substitute for experience.

**III: Surviving the Desert of Despair**
----------------------------------------

1. Have a strong goal for what you want to accomplish because otherwise you will end up chasing your tail learning all kinds of interesting but ultimately unproductive things. If you have the time to spare, by all means skip this...

2. Find a strong path which leads directly to the goal you've set and verify that it will actually get you there. This is where you need to dig deeper than the marketing slogans and smiling faces on course websites or book jackets to ask "will this help me accomplish the goal I've set or not?"
