**Notes about the video**
========================

**The importance of learning patterns:**
------------------------------------

- Always pay attention to patterns as you're learning every concept.
- Spend more time practicing than memorizing. Especially when getting exposed consistently to different concepts will become 2nd nature.

**Re-try old problems:**
---------------------

- Writing down what you think you have to do. (Pseudo coding)

Practice atleast 5 times:
-------------------------

- Re-do the problems you've done 5-7 times in edabit and pick a certain tag or topic and pick a level. (https://edabit.com/)

**Allocate your time:**
---------------------

- While in a bootcamp practice after the end of the day, week, month. 1 hour waking up and 1 hour before sleeping.

Your learning circle should be:
-----------------------------------

1. Research (Knowing where to search the structure of your study material)
2. Content (Knowing if you learn more while doing or reading)
3. Building (Build your own projects in every concept to build upon and remember)
4. Teaching (Feymann technique write notes in github to teach yourself when forgetting certain code structures)
